I created a simple alarm clock project using python and PIP. Pip playsound was used to play the audio file and pip datetime was used to obtain the current time. The user simply enters the desired time with the required format, and the alarm sounds once the entered time matches the current time. The alarm will sound for about 20 seconds or until the user manually ends the program. The alarm sound is the, (totally not annoying), BMW chime.
